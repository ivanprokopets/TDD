# TDD
TDD - Test Driver Development based on the example of the Arabic to Roman number converter

### Description

The converter works as it should. Tests confirm this. If some tests do not work, Iâ€™ll ask about the contact.  
The lines of code below are not an ideal solution, but they work.  
`romanNumber = romanNumber.replace("IIII", "IV");`  
`romanNumber = romanNumber.replace("XXXX", "XL");`  
`romanNumber = romanNumber.replace("CCCC", "CD");`
